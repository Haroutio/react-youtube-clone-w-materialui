# Youtube Clone
This will be a basic youtube clone using React, MaterialUI, and RapidAPI's Youtube V3 api.

UPDATE: Project was overall pretty fun. First time using MaterialUI and it seems pretty appealing, though I kind of prefer TailwindCSS. Both were fairly simple to implement. RapidAPI was interesting although it had some quirks here and there.
